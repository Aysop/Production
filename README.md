# Production

In its current release, this Production Project is a multi-tabbed GUI program, 
that takes user entries from text fields, and inserts them into an H2 database on the first tab,
takes user choice from a product field and quantity combo box on the second, and lastly, a production log field on the third. 
In addition to this, the application is locked and accessible via the "Login" tab, only to those who've been added to the Employee
table of the database- but new users can be added by these users via the "Create Employee" tab.
